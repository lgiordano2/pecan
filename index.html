                 All eyes watched as the massive thunderstorm picked up steam, slogging its way across South Dakota. Thunder began to rumble softly as murky clouds, heavy with rain loomed over Rapid City.
</p>
                <p class="text">
                    An updraft forced aloft by rising damp air propelled a cool breeze back toward the ground, indicating rain was imminent. Towering dense clouds bloomed in the sky. The supercell storm began to release grapefruit-sized hail; a tornado soon developed, delivering wind gusts exeeding 90 miles an hour.
</p>
                <p class="text">
                   “That’s a good tornado,” proclaimed Don Burgess, offering a smile so large his eyes creased at the corners. The 67-year-old self-described storm freak and severe storm expert with NOAA powered up the 14-foot mobile Doppler weather radar. “Or a bad tornado, depending if you are meteorologist or not,” Kevin Hansen, age, a recent graduate of the University of Oklahoma meteorology program replied.

                   But all Burgess and his team could do was to watch the far-flung tornado on the radar screen from their parking spot near a recently harvested wheat field in rural Kansas more than 500 miles away. Instead of collecting data from the severe storm, Burgess and the radar team settled in for a tedious night fulfilling a different objective for the Plains Elevated Convection at Night (PECAN) campaign. It took less than five minutes for Burgess to get the radar up and running leaving the researchers with little to do for the next seven hours. Conversation quickly turned to recounting old war stories from past field projects, random Star War quotes and periodic check-ins with other research teams in the field, all while nostalgically tracking the movement of storm wreaking havoc up north. They were waiting for their own storm – not one with the fury of a tornado–but the power to bring the rain that is the lifeblood of crop survival on the Great Plains and floods that can destroy them.

                 In the simplest of terms, weather is the redistribution of heat in Earth’s atmosphere. The spherical shape of our planet results in more sunlight reaching the equator than the poles–creating a temperature differential. This produces areas of high and low pressure that generate winds stirring up the atmosphere–one of the many intricate interactions happening at any moment in the constantly fluctuating atmosphere.

</p>
                <p class="text">
                    Weather surges through a long list of complex processes not easily replicated in a lab. Forcing scientists to chase after the weather they wish to study–but this time the storm was just a little too far out of reach. The team, along with the other 20 or so other mobile weather units deployed that night, had been waiting more than two weeks for this moment–a near perfect storm was evolving. The radar screen showed several storm cells swirl into one larger mega-storm system forming a mesoscale convective system, known as an MCS and the focus of this weather field project. These systems bring heavy rains and high winds that seemingly without warning can grow severe.

                  In the Great Plains, these nocturnal summer storms produce heavy rainfall, that supplies a significant portion of the region’s annual precipitation bringing with them floods, damaging winds and abundant lightning in an area that extensively supports cattle ranching and farming. Scientists know a great deal about the formation of daytime thunderstorms but what triggers and feeds nighttime storms remains a mystery. </p>
                <p class="text">
             “In the central U.S. you sometimes see these [nighttime] storms popping up out of seemly nothing. I was really curious to figure what is there.” says Tammy Weckworth one of the principal investigators on the PECAN project and an atmospheric scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. “Something had to be there to cause these storms to form.”

All thunderstorms require the same three ingredients to form: moisture, instability and a lifting mechanism or trigger. During the day the sun heats the ground warming the nearby air. This damp air is less dense and lighter than the cooler air above, causing it to become unstable and rise. This warm upsurge is the trigger or source of energy that initiates daytime thunderstorms. As this air continues to ascend, temperatures fall dramatically, condensing the small liquid droplets that form colossal cumulonimbus clouds resembling heads of cauliflower. These ice crystals will eventually grow large enough, overpowering the updraft that continuously feeds the cloud, and fall back to earth as rain. 
</p>
                <p class="text">
                “Those same conditions don’t exist at night without the sun to heat the surface. Nighttime storms are really a much more complicated difficult problem to understand. And also hard to measure with our existing instrumentation,” Weckworth says. At night when the sun disappears, ground temperatures drop, cooling the nearby air which then becomes more stable and the air does not rise, she notes. Conditions become less favorable for the formation of thunderstorms near the ground; instead the unstable air is elevated above the surface. “But higher up in the atmosphere where things are forming at night, those observations are harder to achieve,” Weckworth says.

               Four years after a hallway conversation sparked a dialogue about the difficulties of predicting nocturnal storms, 
more than 100 scientists, from eight research laboratories, including NOAA, NASA and 14 universities, gathered in Kansas for PECAN amassing a unique set of instruments. Their army included eight radar trucks, a dozen mobile weather units, also known as a mesonets, three aircraft and seven fixed sites (strategically position around the Great Plains). Along with tried and true Doppler radar and weather balloons already used to make daily forecasts, they wanted to test a network of vertical profilers (AERIs) with the capability of continuously measuring temperature, moisture and winds throughout the lowest 3, 4, 5 kilometers (approximately 1.8-3 miles) of the atmosphere. Current operational instrumentation is focused on measuring air flow, temperature and moisture close to the surface. PECAN scientists hypothesized a network vertical profilers, like the AERI that specializes in measuring vertical profiles of air elevated above the surface, could drastically improve weather predictions for nocturnal storms. They wanted to know which ones would intensify becoming severe, or simply sputter out. Finding the trigger could result in better models, or simulations, that would help forecasters make more accurate–and faster–predictions about severe storms.

Along with boredom, weather fieldwork is mercilessly grueling, especially when hunting for clues to nighttime deluges. Hurry up and wait was the de-facto motto developed over the summer. Weather is constantly shifting so exact locations for teams were determined at the very last moment to insure ideal sites were chosen. Sluggish, unwieldy radar installations that moved slowly were often sent early leaving many teams waiting for hours in Walmart parking lots waiting for orders--then scrambling into position with sudden haste.

Some scientists adopted a nocturnal lifestyle during the PECAN campaign, completely reversing their sleep schedule and they tended to be the best rested. Not such a bad idea as the sun baked the brittle prairie surrounding Hays late into the afternoon during those long summer months. One researcher described fieldwork like a box of chocolates–you can never get enough but sometimes you’ve had too much. 

 </p>
                <p class="text">
                But the field scientists treasure the hunt. Even as a young scientist, meteorologist Don Burgess, always preferred chasing after weather than sitting behind a desk. “I would sneak into the radar room and watch what was going on. See the teletypes and the radar display,” says Burgess reminiscing about some of the earliest weather research field projects.  “[I] thought all that was grand stuff. Of course I had no business in there, so they would kick me out.”

                <p class="text">
                 
Well into the 20th century, meteorology was considered a descriptive science with the birth of modern meteorology emerging from advances in radar and communication technology developed for World War II.  During the war radar, operators discovered precipitation created echoes on radar screens–snow, sleet and rain could be located and monitored. Prior to the war only surface-based weather instruments existed. “That’s like saying we know what’s going on here,” Burgess said pointing to the land surrounding him. “But the atmosphere is three-dimensional and there is all this huge space up there where stuff is happening and we knew very little about that,” he said motioning high into the sky.

</p>
                <p class="text">
                   The first weather satellite, TIROS I, was launched in 1960 by NASA, only operated for 78 days yet it ushered in a new way of observing the weather. The polar-orbiting satellite relayed thousands of images surveying the structure and progression of large scale clouds and weather patterns. Scientists could now track and survey global weather patterns that covered several states or even countries. 



 </p>
                <p class="text">
                   “The problem with satellites is that they don’t give us that vertical resolution information particularly close to the ground where it is really critical to get a good estimate of the stability of the atmosphere,” Weckworth says. “We really need to know the stability and the satellite doesn’t give us enough information.”  The lowest layer of the atmosphere, the troposphere, roughly the lowest 6 miles of the atmosphere, contains almost all the weather in the atmosphere and satellites orbit many layers above. So despite the immense advancements in satellite and radar technology, meteorologists still rely on very old technology–weather balloons–to sample the lower the part of the atmosphere essential for numeric weather models needed to create forecasts.

                   The predecessor to the National Weather Service, the Weather Bureau, began launching small balloons in 1909 to obtain wind information. In the late 1920s scientist began attaching miniaturized instrument packages with radio transmitters or “radiosondes” to balloons. This new technology immediately transmitted weather data to the ground, scientists no longer had to hunt for downed balloons in the hopes of retrieving their data. 


 </p>
 <p class="text">
Weather balloon technology hasn’t changed radically since the first weather network was established in 1909, although in the 80s telemetry automated the process, dropping personnel necessary for launches from three to one. Still in tandem, twice a day, every day, at approximately the same time, over 800 locations world-wide launch a weather balloon. Duane Wolfe, 65, is one of the 82 technicians in the US charged with this daily task. The retired air force officer turned hydrometeorologist (a fancy name for an atmospheric researcher) launches balloons from the National Weather Service outpost in Dodge City, Kansas.

Each morning and afternoon, after donning his beige baseball cap Wolfe strolls out the back door toward a small garage with a large white dome resting on top. Expertly he pumps helium into the lifeless three-foot heavy white balloon. After the balloon has grown to nearly six feet in diameter, Wolfe attaches the radiosonde instrumentation and without any fanfare releases it. The balloon quickly disappeared into the cloudy sky, taking the pulse of the atmosphere during its roughly two-hour trip skyward ascending to an altitude that can exceed 35km (21 miles). Wolfe returns to his desk waiting for the data to transmit, as the balloon gradually rises a decrease in pressure will cause the balloon to expand–bursting after reaching a diameter of about 20-25 feet and fall back towards the Great Plains. Hours later the data will be fed into numeric models to create future forecasts.

Back in PECAN operational headquarters in Hays, doctoral student Kevin Haghi paced between his computer and the window. His computer had him shackled on an invisible leash, refusing to let him wander more than a few feet away from his computer screen. Haghi’s tired eyes screamed frustration. Peering out the window, Haghi noticed dark clouds forming, the predicted storm just might be forming. 
 </p>
   <p class="text">
“The storms can hear us in here,” Haghi whispered unable to relax. “And Mother Nature likes to play with us.”  </p>

   <p class="text">
The week before a high pressure system settled over the Great Plains smothering all atmospheric activity. Crews were restless, many needed quality data sets for their research. The dome of heat had finally lifted with just days left in the experiment and a new kind of pressure was felt. Under Haghi’s command was a mobile fleet of radar and weather stations already fanning out across Kansas. Haghi was part of the group studying bores, a unique atmospheric ripple, which can cause thunderstorms to suddenly intensify or even form new storms--very little is known how bores might trigger and support large complexes of thunderstorms.   </p>
   <p class="text">
Even after tonight’s storm finally formed it continued to tease Haghi and other scientists--it would weaken, looking good for bore creation, then pick up strength, dashing hopes of collecting bore data that night. Dave Imy the lead forecaster for the night, referred to Haghi’s desire for the supercell to fizzle as “wishcasting.”  </p>
   <p class="text">
“Remember we are forecasters so we have the right to change our minds,” Imy offers in jest.  </p>
   <p class="text">

Haghi shook his head at the forecaster. The last thing he wanted was a failed mission, a repeat from earlier in the project. Haghi eventually settled in—one hand held an ice coffee for an immediate jolt, the other contained a very large energy drink meant to sustain him late into the night. The entire project had been a catch-22, scientists wanted to improve numerical forecasts models but first they needed to accurately predict the storm so they could strategically position the mobile fleet using their main tool--numerical forecast models.

                   <p class="text">When asked why forecasting is so hard many professors of meteorology start with a story about a scientist named Edward Lorenz. A few of these explanations begin right after lunch—when Lorenz returned to his lab he reran a weather simulation. Some say it was laziness, but nonetheless he only inputted numbers to the third decimal place, rather than the original five. To his surprise this resulted in a prediction with a radically different weather trajectory than the original. </p>

 <p class="text">Lorenz realized a very minute change in initial conditions created significant differences. What if a cloud stuck around longer than expected, or the temperature in this tiny area is a little lower or higher? A very small difference that could result in prediction of a storm system fizzling out in the Gulf, missing New Orleans or slamming right into the coast.
</p>

 <p class="text">“Forecasting is difficult for several reasons. We don’t understand all of the physical processes that take place in the atmosphere in detail,” said Steve Weiss director of the Science Support Branch at NOAA’s Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. “How do you write code to represent some physical processes if you don’t understand the processes very well? Your code is not going to be very good.”

It’s not so much the old technology of weather balloons that frustrates scientists and forecasters, but the small amount of data collected. In much of the world–over the oceans and in many developing countries–no weather balloons are launched, creating massive gaps in the weather data information. And locations that do release weather balloons may miss any weather system that forms or travels through an area during the long pause between the twice daily launches. 
</p>

 <p class="text">“We don’t sample or observe the atmosphere in enough detail. There are a lot of gaps, we don’t have information on what’s taking place in every square meter in the atmosphere. So if you don’t know what’s going on in part of the atmosphere or your estimates are wrong, how are you going to make a forecast?” asks Weiss. “And if we don’t have it sampled extremely well, errors are going to start to creep in into the forecasts. And sometimes those errors can be rather dramatic, when it comes to things like thunderstorms.
</p>

 <p class="text">It doesn’t help that the weather is probably the only science everyone thinks about every day, and many meteorologists point out forecasting is often a thankless job. No one ever gathers around the water cooler at work and says, “Man, that weather guy did a great job of predicting the high of 74 yesterday.” We remember the failures, perhaps even thinking they happen much more often than they actually do.

                As residents in the far southeastern town of Yankton, South Dakota, squeezed in one last fireworks display before the Fourth of July weekend officially came to a close, PECAN scientists busily prepared for their own evening’s entertainment. NOAA scientist and a principal project investigator, David Turner and two graduate students purposely positioned themselves right in the path of a violent air-mass barreling through the Great Plains. 

</p>

 <p class="text">That morning wispy clouds high in the sky greeted the researchers as they awakened–a tad grumpy due to lack of sleep and a disappointing mission from the night before. Before that, a broken generator forced them to the sideline for another mission, setting their handmade “morale-o-meter” precariously balanced between the sad face and outright tears. Just a few precious days remained in the field campaign, everyone yearned for bad weather.
</p>

 <p class="text">“Even the Weather Channel has us going to the right place,” said Turner mockingly confident storms would develop making the eight-hour drive to South Dakota worth the team’s effort. 
</p>

 <p class="text">Turner approaches life with a spring in his step and his boyish face almost never shedding a smile. Unlike most weather geeks who became fascinated with clouds and storms at young age, Turner accidently stumbled into atmospheric science after studying math. Decades later he found himself crisscrossing the Great Plains, still storm chasing. 
 </p>

 <p class="text">
From the outside, the windowless white 8-foot by 5-foot trailer gave no hint of the high-tech interior. Tucked in between the costly equipment was a rudimentary drawing of the team’s “morale-o-meter. Until now the hand-drawn needle had hovered around the happy face. Sometimes, though, depending on the amount of Mexican food the team had consumed, the needle straddled the two highest states of being: “super happy face” and “burrito.” The indicator leaped off the charts the night their deployment site sat behind a 24-hour Taco Bell. By daylight, morale had dropped.

                 <p class="text">Turner’s unit the Collaborative Lower Atmospheric Mobile Profiling System, the CLAMPS unit, was a state of the arc system that could rapidly profile the ever changing boundary layer, roughly the lowest one or two kilometers (.6-1.2 miles) of the atmosphere. In this layer, temperatures are the most strongly impacted by daytime heating and nighttime cooling, capturing the evolution of this layer during a storm was essential to answering the questions the PECAN campaign sought. 
</p>

 <p class="text">Rain began to fall, finding it’s way inside the trailer. “My morale meter is going down because of all the leaks,” said Turner sadly, turning to his team. Completed right before the PECAN project was set begin left no time to test the mobile weather station resilience before it’s maiden voyage. The team swiftly plugged holes while the storm rolled over. One piece of equipment the team wanted to keep dry was that Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (AERI). The AERI collect vertical weather profiles like a weather balloon but without having to leave the ground. It was the largest radar in the team’s arsenal.
</p>
<p class="text">
“Radar trucks do a great job of characterizing precipitation, the mobile mesonets tells you what’s happening two meters above the ground, but what’s happening higher up we don’t know, at least not in high resolution,” Turner explained. “The general tool was always these radiosondes (weather balloons), which are great but you can only launch a radiosonde so quickly.”
</p>

            <div class="col-md-5 col-md-offset-2">
                <p class="text">Instead of being forced to wait for the next weather balloon launch to collect the weather data needed, the AERI can constantly vertically profile the atmosphere. Developing and testing a network of these vertical profilers was one of Turner’s main goals for PECAN. He believes the AERI will be a tremendous advantage for the Weather Service and everyday forecasts. During PECAN, scientists installed AERIs at six fixed sites and two mobile units to test how a network of AERIs could advance forecasting.
 </p>
 <p class="text">“While the radiosondes might take an hour to fly up to its altitude, the AERI gives you this measurement in 15 seconds,” said Turner. And unlike weather balloons which can veer off course, the AERI never moves. “It’s going to give you a temperature and humidity profile value at each altitude but it’s going to be straight up and going to be instantaneous,” said Turner.
 </p>

 <p class="text">With all the advancements in weather instruments, Weckworth still sees an important role for weather balloons. “It is old technology but we aren’t going to get rid of the thermometer either,” she said. “These profiling instruments like AERI, that continuously measures temperature and moisture, can help fill in the gaps of the weather balloons. But I really don’t seem them replacing the capabilities of the weather balloons.”
</p>
  <p class="text">Forecasts have dramatically improved in the just last few decades due to innovation in super computing and sophisticated equations. To generate forecasts involves a fleet of instruments, not just one standalone: a combination of satellites, weather balloons with an addition of a networks of AERIs could prove to be a very powerful and comprehensive tool for forecasters. Perhaps adding hours or even days to predictions lead time. But first PECAN scientists must first return to their labs to begin the daunting task of combing through the mounds of data collected. 
 </p>
 <p class="text">“This was a fantastic experiment with a large number of instruments and participants. There are so many unique ways we can analysis the data just because of the shear number of different types of instruments,” Turner concluded. 
  </p>



 <p class="text">By 10 p.m. forceful winds shook the trailer while spider webs of lightning swept across the sky with each crash of thunder. The team was just one of the ten radar trucks, a dozen mobile mesonets, three aircraft and seven fixed sites collecting data on the same storm that night. From their computer screen the CLAMPS team watched the MCS cruised right over the “megagon” formed by Burgess’s team and other the mobile radar units farther to the west. Weeks from now graduate students and professors will begin to log the many hours necessary to crunch the data using super computers to analyze their findings, but first before all that can happen, the team must venture out during a thunderstorm and launch a weather balloon.

</p>
<p class="text">The two graduate students pulled on stiff yellow rain jackets and pants, the last launch of the night would be tricky in the strong winds. But he send off was no problem for the team after many weeks of practice launching weather balloons in nasty weather. A quick tear down of the site was motivated by the pouring rain. The dense clouds began to break up as the team drove toward their hotel for what was left of the night.
